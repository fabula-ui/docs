# Description

The **wrapper** helper component is a wrapper component that lets you handle utilities and responsiveness properties properly.

Because of the way Fabula is structured and utilities are handled, you need to use either **element** or **wrapper** components.

The **wrapper** component is advised to be used for block objects - it uses `block` display property by default.
