# Description

The **element** helper component is a wrapper component that lets you handle utilities and responsiveness properties properly.

Because of the way Fabula is structured and utilities are handled, you need to use either **element** or **wrapper** components - rather than a div, span, etc.

The **element** component is advised to be used for inline elements - it uses `inline-block` display property by default.
