# Color

The **color** property adds color to the component.

Fabula can detect if the value you are passing is a hexadecimal value, a color defined on your theme or a universal color name.

In addition to this property, you can also use [color utilities](/docs/utilities/color) such as `darken`, `faded` and `lighten`.
