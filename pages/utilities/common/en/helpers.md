# HTML Elements

Because of the way Fabula is structured and utilities are handled, you need to use either **element** or **wrapper** components - rather than a div, span, etc.

**Wrapper** component is advised to be used for block elements - it uses `block` display property by default - while **element** component is advised to be used for inline elements - it uses `inline-block` display property.
