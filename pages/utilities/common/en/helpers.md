# HTML Elements

Because of the way Fabula is structured and utilities are handled, you can't use them straight on **html elements** - you need to use either **element** or **wrapper** components.

**Wrapper** component is advised to be used for block objects - it uses `block` display property by default - while **element** component is advised to be used for inline objects - it uses `inline-block` display property.
