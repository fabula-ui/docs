# Variables

As mentioned before, Fabula has three type of variables: **global variables**, **color variables** and **component variables**.

You can find the list of all [global](/docs/variables/globals) and [color](/docs/variables/colors) variables on the **Variables** section of this documentation.

Each of the **components** documented here presents a list of variables at the very end of its relative page.
