# Utilities

Fabula is packed with a few utility properties that will help you structure your application. 

These utility properties were designed in a way that they are incredibly easy to apply on components and even better - they can be dynamic.

You can understand more about utilities, how they work individually and how to import them on the **Utilities** section.
