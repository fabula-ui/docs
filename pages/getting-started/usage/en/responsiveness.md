# Responsiveness

Fabula has its own way of handling responsiveness. While it's still on an experimental phase, you can try it and help us by [reporting bugs](/docs/contributing/#reporting-bugs).

These responsiveness properties can handle the component properties and even utility properties.

You can check how to set up and make your application responsive on the **Responsiveness** section.
