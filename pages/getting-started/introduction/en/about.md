# About Fabula

Fabula is an open-source component ecosystem designed to help developers across the world deliver beautiful applications. It focus on making it easier to customize everything inside it, from components all the way to variables and colors. 

It is currently on a beta version for **React** and **Angular**, which means you can stumble across a few bugs while working with it. 

You can help Fabula grow stronger and stable by [reporting bugs](/docs/getting-started/contributing/#reporting-bugs), [requesting features](/docs/getting-started/contributing/#requesting-features) or even [improving this documentation](/docs/getting-started/contributing/#improving-docs). Fabula is yours too!
