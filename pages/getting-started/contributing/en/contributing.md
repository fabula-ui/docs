Fabula is and always will be 100% open-source. To help make Fabula grow stronger and even easier to use you can **report bugs** whenever you catch one, **improve the documentation** when you feel something might be wrong or missing or you can **request a new feature** if you think Fabula misses something. 

Also, if you want to get engaged and work with me on Fabula, send a message right now on <a href="https://www.twitter.com/fabula-ui" target="_blank">Twitter</a> or send an <a href="mailto:fabulaui@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>. I'd love to hear more from you!
