# Description

The **colors** global variable is set beforehand to define the colors that are used on a project. 

Out of the box, Fabula provides you with a set of colors that will work right away on your project. You can customize them or add new colors while [setting up your theme](/docs/getting-started/customizing).

All colors added to the **colors** variable can be globally accessed anytime you want - usually through properties such as **color**, **text color**, etc.
