- /pages/helpers - `Documentation related to Helpers section`

## Translating Fabula

To create a new translation, you need to follow the current structure that is used on the documentation's folders.

### On /pages

If you navigate inside `pages` folder, you will find folders for each language present on Fabula right now. Inside this language folder are the same files, translated to that language.
Create a new folder with the new language initials and copy the files from an existing language, so you are ready to start the translation.

### On /ui

Differently from `pages` folder, if you open the `ui` folder you will find the language folders with two files each: `categories.yaml` and `dictionary.yaml`. Create a new folder with the new language initials and copy both files to it to start the translation.
